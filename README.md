How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I like to implement SOLID design principles when i am writing code this assists me in makeing clean and well optimized solutions i also like to make code that can be clear to read with or without comments. To me comments are great to spell things out when they are murky but in my professional experince it is much more beneficial to have easily understandable and well structured code where comments are a secondary way of identifing the proces. I have no plans in the near future to use the CRUD python module but i do work with CRUD systems on a very regular basis reaching out to SQL systems i have also begun to identify ORM solutions that make this CRUD setup even easier to do. 

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I feel like i have a fairly well solidifyed process comeing into this class i was able to read the requirments to the best of my abilitys and break down what needed to be done into small easily worked on chunks and i tackle them one at a time the class was also broken up in this way assisting that process in its own way. For my plans in creating databases for the future i will more then likely use a ORM code first solutioin instead of manually building databases or useing CSVs to create them. 



What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer Scientists are problem solvers we take someones requests and we find a solution to this problem. In many businesses this is extreamly important. Say your CEO wants to see the produdtivity visualized for the whole company he may bring that request to comp scientist and then that is there role to create a solution to this request and help the CEO meet his goal and essentially i beleive this to be the primary role "Problem Solver".
